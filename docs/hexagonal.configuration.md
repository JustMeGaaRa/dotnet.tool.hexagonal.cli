# dotnet hexa config

## Configuration

The tool supports a small set of configurable options for those who desire some minor variations for the commonly used standards. The configuration supports the following parameters to change:

```json
{
    "framework": {
        "default": "net5.0" // Use typical TFMs for .NET
    },
    "folders": {
        "clients_folder": "clients",
        "docs_folder": "docs",
        "samples_folder": "samples",
        "services_folder": "services",
        "webapps_folder": "webapps",
    }
}
```

In order to change the configuration, please got to the tool folder and change it manually.
